<h1>Redbird Gaming Club</h1>
<p>The Redbird Gaming club is a student club at Skagit Valley College that I run with my friend Ace.<br>
We play Dungeons and Dragons every other week, and on the weeks in between we play other games such as Catan, <br>
Jackbox, various card games, and more!</p>

<p>
We meet every Friday at 4PM in the Birch office 100 at 4 pm, and <br>
play games until around 7 or 8, depending on how it goes.
