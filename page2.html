<h1>The world of our DnD campagin</h1>
<p>
	I'm a DM, that's short for "Dungeon Master," which means that I'm in charge of <br>
creating the world for the other DnD players to play in as their characters. </p>

<p>
	The world I created for our campagn at Redbird Gaming Club is mostly covered<br>
in a massive ocean, with one giant continent. This continent has a ring of grasslands<br>
and forests along the coastlines, while the middle is covered in a giant desert that<br>
appears to boil, as the sand constantly moves, making it impossible to stand on.</p>

<p>
	Giant wooden spires tower above this desert, cylindrical cities that stretch over<br>
a mile into the air, each appearing to be made out of one singular peice of wood.<br>
These spires are connected by thick, incredibly long cables that carry cable cars<br>
between the spires. These cable cars, or gondalas, are the size of buildings, and<br>
many of them are small businesses, with others being owned by the government of<br>
the continent, known as the nation of Tonthrop.
